<p>A really simple mailing list package written in Python and intended for those who do not have a dedicated server.  Simply take any POP3 account and turn it into a full featured mailing list.</p>
<h2>Project Description</h2>

<P>JMLM is a very simple mailing list package that operates against an existing POP3 account and doesn't need any sort of dedicated server or access to the mail servers config.  Simple:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Create a POP3 account for the mailing list: ie) list@myhost.com
<LI>Setup the mailing list by edit jmlm.py
<LI>Run jmlm.py periodically.  It will retrieve the messages from the POP account and process them.
</OL>
<P>This list will work against free POP3 accounts and you can even use dialup accounts for the mailing list software assuming you don't mind a little latency :)</P>
<P>The software is essentially complete now.  It's very simple and certainly won't handle large lists but it works and does the normal things you expect.      </P>
<H1 class="jdocHeader"><a name="sect_1.">1. Features</a></H1>
<UL>
<LI>BSD licensed.  Have fun with it
<LI>Can insert list name into subject
<LI>Can append a footer onto messages
<LI>Can limit size of messages posted to list
<LI>Can bounce messages not from subscribers
<LI>Can push list address into Reply-to field
<LI>Easy to setup and use.  Simply edit the script source and run it.  20sec mailing list.
</UL>
<H1 class="jdocHeader"><a name="sect_2.">2. Configuration</a></H1>
<P>Configuration is pretty simple.  Just edit source code and modify the variables near the top.  You can even tweak the reply messages when the server has something to say.</P>
<P>There are comments in the source code to give you a clue as to what you are editing.  Just remember to be careful.  Strings are encludes in quotes, boolean values are True or False.  That sort of thing. </P>
<P>The messages MSG_... are just the message body of what gets sent on server messages.  You can tweak it if you like.   The %(...)s stuff is templating code for putting in things like the original message, the time and date, their address, etc.</P>
<P>Bare minimum you will need to setup SMTP_SERVER, POP3_SERVER, POP3_USER, POP3_PASS, LIST_NAME, LIST_ADDR, LIST_OWNER and LIST_KEY</P>
<H1 class="jdocHeader"><a name="sect_3.">3. Usage</a></H1>
<P>Simply run the program with Python 2.2 or higher and it will tell you what you need to know.  Basically the -p option tells it to poll the POP3 account for new messages and process them.  The -l option lists subscribers and -s and -u subscribe and unsubscribe users.</P>
<P>Have fun and let me know if you use it please.</P>
